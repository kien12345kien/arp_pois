Function send_arp(type, sip, smac, tip, tmac):

   Declare variables:
       t: to store ARP packet information
       l: to reference libnet object
       c: to store return value of libnet_write

   Check if libnet object is initialized:
       If not, report an error and stop execution

   Lock sending mechanism to prevent conflicts

   If the ARP request is broadcast:
       Set target MAC address to ARP_BROADCAST

   Build ARP packet with the following details:
       - ETHERNET
       - IP
       - Hardware address size
       - Protocol address size
       - Operation type: ARP(request or reply)
       - Sender MAC and IP addresses: smac, sip
       - Target MAC and IP addresses: tmac, tip

   Check for errors in building the ARP packet:
       If error occurs, report it and stop execution

   If the ARP request has ARP_BROADCAST as the target MAC:
       Set target MAC to MEDIA_BROADCAST

   Add link layer (media) header for Ethernet transmission

   Check if link layer construction was successful:
       If not, report an error and stop execution

   Write the ARP packet to the network

   Check if packet write was successful:
       If not, report the error

   Clear the packet to free up memory

   Unlock sending mechanism

   Return the result of the write operation
